# Multi-Page Website with HTML 

This project has been a fantastic journey into the world of web development. Here’s what I’ve learned and implemented so far:

### ✨ Semantic HTML Tags:
- Used `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>` tags to add meaning and structure to my pages.  
These elements help in making the website more accessible and well-organized.

### ✨ Essential Elements:
- Incorporated the `©` symbol to ensure my content is well-protected and looks professional. 
This project has been a great opportunity to solidify my understanding of HTML and its practical applications.
Can’t wait to continue building and learning more about HTML, CSS, and web design!
